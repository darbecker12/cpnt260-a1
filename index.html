    <h2>About the Mall</h2>
    <p>
      At one time, <strong>West Edmonton Mall</strong> was the largest mall in the world. Now, it is still the largest mall in North America. Opening in 1981, the mall has gone through various expansions. These expansions have added many additions to the mall like a hotel, a waterpark, an indoor lake with a pirate ship, and more. One of the recent additions to the mall is a multi-story go-kart track. This attraction is beside the <em>Galaxy Land</em> amusement park which is also one of the world's largest indoor amusement parks. The <em>Drive! Racing Karts</em> attraction opened in 2020 and uses electric karts on an 850ft track over 3-stories. Inspired by New York, the walls have many hand-painted scenes to race past. With this new addition, <strong>West Edmonton Mall</strong> is sure to attract even more visitors. Because of the many shopping options, attractions, and more, the mall has made a name for itself as a landmark in Alberta.
